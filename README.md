# Exercise: C# and ASP.NET Core

This document defines several walkthroughs for creating ASP.NET Core MVC-based apps, from setting up the framework to implementing the fully functional applications.

## Non-Data-Driven Apps: 
These are apps, which do not need a database to work.

### Calculator
This document defines a complete walkthrough of creating a Calculator application with the ASP.NET Core Framework, from setting up the framework to implementing the fully functional application.

#### Base Project Overview
Our project will be built, using the C# language and the MVC framework ASP.NET Core. We’ll use the Razor View Engine to define our views.

# Lab: Creating a Blog with ASP.NET MVC

In this lab, we shall create a fully-functional Blog System in ASP.NET MVC with SQL Server database using Entity Framework and MVC. This tutorial is part of the “Software Technologies” course @ SoftUni.

## Overview
ASP.MVC – this is a web application framework developed by Microsoft, which implements the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern, with which you should already be familiar with. In other words, this gives you a bare bone working web app (you will see that you can start it immediately after creating the project) out of the box, on top of which you can build your own app. Consider it our foundation.
Entity Framework – basically, this gives you a way to interact with a database by making you see database objects (tables) as classes (It is analogous to Doctrine, which you have already used but is very different). Once familiar with object-oriented programming you should appreciate how handy this is.
SQL – query language used for managing a database. In our case, Entity Framework will take care of this.
